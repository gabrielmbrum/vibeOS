# vibeOS

this is a OS simulator, where you can create process from the programs (inside programs/) and see the executing of all of them, beyond that you can see the memory status, I/O request and other things.

to enjoy it, follow the 'Setting and Running' instructions ;)

please, dont forget that this isnt just a operating system, this is a vibe 🪴
